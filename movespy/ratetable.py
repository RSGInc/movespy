''' This module defines two functions:

- getRateTable
- getAverageSpeedRateTable

Use these functions to generate lookup tables for emissions rates.

import moves


def getRateTable(activity,
                 options,
                 operating_mode_ids = None,
                 source_type_ids = None):
    #to do: add option to select pollutants (for faster runs)

    '''Get an emissions rate lookup table.

    Parameters

    
    - activity: a dictionary structured exactly like the activity parameter
      to the moves.Moves initializer, except that it does not have the `links` key.

    - options: a dictionary structured like the options parameter to the moves.Moves
      initializer, except that only the 'breakdown' key is allowed, and the only
      value allowed in the list is 'process'

    - operating_mode_ids: a sequence of operating mode IDs to be included in the lookup
      table. Optional; if it is not included all operating modes
      will be included. Limiting the number of operating modes will make
      this function go faster

    - source_type_ids: as above, but for source type IDs. 


    Return Value

    Returns a list of dictionaries.
    Each dictionary has keys for opmode, pollutant, source, and quantity;
    and optionally for process.
    All quantity values are for one vehicle hour, and are either in grams or kJ. 

    Example::

        >>> activity =  {'age_distr': {21: {5: 1.0},
        ...                        11: {5: 1.0}},
        ...          'county': 50027,
        ...          'day_type': 5,
        ...          'hour': 16,
        ...          'month': 6,
        ...          'year': 2015}

        >>> options = {}

        >>> table =  getRateTable(activity,
        ...                   options,
        ...                   operating_mode_ids = [0, 1],
        ...                   source_type_ids = [11, 21])
        running MOVES ...

    Parameters

    
    - activity: a dictionary structured exactly like the activity paramter
      to the moves.Moves initializer, except that it does not have the `links` key.

    - roadtype_grade_speed: a sequence of tuples. Each is tuple of road type id,
      grade, and speed. Road type IDs can be found in the MOVES database. Grade
      is given in percent, and speed in miles per hour. 

    - source_type_ids: a sequence of source type IDs to be included in the lookup
      table. Optional; if it is not given all source types
      will be included. Limiting the number of source types will make
      this function go faster


    Return Value

    Returns a nested dict keyed by pollutant, source type, roadtype, grade, speed
    All values are for one vehicle hour, and are either in grams or kJ.
