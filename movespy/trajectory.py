''' Functions for calculating VSP and operating mode from trajectory data.


Users typically use only one function from this module: getVSPOpMode.
The arguments to this function can be viewed as different columns
from a single data table. Each argument is typically a
one-dimensional numpy array, but may also be a single value that
is then broadcast. The function returns two values: an array of vsp values,
and an array of operating mode values.

An example with 3 separate vehicles and 12 vehicle-seconds:


>>> veh = [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3]
>>> speed = [3.,6.,1.,3.,8.,5.,6.,3.,9.,1.,3.,9.]
>>> grade = [1.,2.,-3.,1.,2.,1.,3.,1.,-2.,3.,-4.,-2.]
>>> mass, mass_factor, alpha, beta, gamma = 2., 1.5, 0.16, 0.0020, 0.00049
>>> vsp, opmode = getVSPOpMode(veh, speed, grade, mass, mass_factor, alpha, beta, gamma)
>>> opmode
array([12, 13,  0, 12, 12,  0, 12, 12, 16,  0, 12, 16])
>>> vsp[:5].round(2)
array([ 0.15,  5.8 , -1.46,  1.92,  0.41])

def _getVSP(speed_mps, accel_mpsps, mass_tonnes, mass_factor, alpha, beta, gamma):
    '''Calculates VSP

    Parameters:

      - `speed_mps`: the current speed of the vehicle (meters per second)
      - `accel_mpsps`: the current acceleration including acceleration from gravity (mpsps)
      - `grade_percent`: the roadway grade (percent)
      - `mass_tonnes`: mass of the vehicle (metric tons) 
      - `mass_factor`: the fixed mass factor 
      - `alpha, beta, gamma`: parameters to the VSP equation

    All parameters should be usable as numpy arrays. Numpy broadcasting
    may be used.

    The mass_factor values and VSP equation parameters are in the
    sourceusetype table in the MOVES database.

    Returns:

      - VSP (kW / tonne ?)

def _getAccel(veh, speed_mps, grade_percent, simple = False):

    Parameters:

      - `veh`: a sequence of vehicle IDs
      - `speed_mps`: current speed (meters per second)
      - `current`: current grade (percent)

    All three parameters must be of equal length and
    sorted to correspond to each other.
    
    The parameters must be sorted so that all rows from
    a vehicle are grouped together, and sorted within
    each group by time.
    
    Rows must correspond to observations taken one second apart.

    All parameters should be usable as one-dimensional numpy arrays.
    Numpy broadcasting may be used.

    Returns:

      - A tuple of three acceleration arrays for the current acceleration,
        the acceleration one second ago, and the acceleration two seconds
        ago, all in meters per second per second.

    For cases where the lagged speed or grade is not available, the acceleration
    is set to zero following the calculations in MOVES.

    If `simple` is True then a simplified calculation will be used to
    determine the effect of grade on acceleration. This eliminates
    two trigonometric functions and results in relative errors of less
    than two percent for grades between -20 and 20.
